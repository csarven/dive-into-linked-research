                            <p>The future of scholarly communication involves research results, analysis and data all being produced, published, verified and reused interactively on the Web, with 'papers' linking to and from each other at a granular level. The academic process of peer-review can be open, transparent and decentralised, and the mechanism for global knowledge sharing becomes an ongoing collaborative conversation between experts, policy makers, implementers, and the general public.</p>

                            <p>This vision is radical, and getting there requires understanding of, and change in, a number of interrelated areas. In this article we break down the problem space and define requirements for advancement towards a Web-based ecosystem for scholarly communication: <em>Linked Research</em>. We discuss our strategy for tackling each of these areas. This includes how we can build on and combine existing well-known technologies and practices for digital publishing, social interactions, decentralised data storage, and semantic data enrichment. We provide an initial assessment of our proposed strategy with an example implementation of tooling which sets out to meet the requirements.</p>

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete</q> - attributed to <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a></cite>.</p>

                            <p>One of the most widely debated questions in the scientific community is the impact of digitisation on scholarly communication and knowledge exchange.
                            In this article, we propose that digitising, and indeed <i>Webizing </i>[cite], scholarly communication can provide greater coherency between and within academic fields, as well as make knowledge more accessible to researchers and citizens alike.Â Despite efforts through Open Access movements and increasing availability of online publications, researchers are still writing static documents, and surprisingly little has been done to take full advantage of either the capabilities of online media, or the cultural shift towards sharing and public commentary on social networks.Â </p><p>On examination, it becomes clear that there are many interrelated problems to be tackled before it will be possible to fully realise the possibilities offered by modern Web technologies in the academic space. Many of these problems are relevant in a number of domains outside of scholarly publishing, and they are each to different degrees being considered in existing or ongoing work, in both academia and industry. However, work in the different areas is often disconnected. Our first contribution is an overview of different issues, and how they relate to and depend upon one another, in the context of scholarly communication. We attempt to articulate a complete picture of the space by defining <i>requirementsÂ </i>in response to the problems described in existing literature, or observed 'in the field'. These requirements fall into three broad categories:</p><ul><li>Information silos and centralisation.</li><li>Access, discovery and reuse of knowledge and data.</li><li>User experience and tooling.<br /></li></ul>

                            <p>From these requirements, we derive user stories, and explain how these may be repurposed as an <i>acid test</i>Â or criteria against which to evaluate proposed solutions. Our strategy for addressing the problems identified involves building upon existing technologies, standards and common practices, each of which we discuss in detail in section 4.Â </p><p>Finally, we describe an implementation of tooling for authoring, publishing and annotating research articles in a decentralised manner, based on native Web technologies. We demonstrate how multimodal content such as video, audio, code examples and runnable experiments can be embedded into research publications, andÂ showcase how different views of the content can be rendered for different devices (e.g. screen, print, mobile) or audiences (e.g. slideshows).Â A particular strength of our approach is the integration and linking of data, which can automatically update tables and diagrams when the underlying data changes. All content can be annotated and represented using semantic knowledge representation formalisms to facilitate better search, exploration, retrieval and linking of concepts and ideas. Development is ongoing, and we use this as a starting point to demonstrate the feasibility of our strategy.</p>

                            <p><strong>Human and machine-readability.</strong>
                            Current scholarly communication (mainly articles in PDF) is not machine-readable to the extend that automatic processing of the content is possible.
                            Machine-readability to the extend that the structure and semantic of the content is accessible for software is a prerequisite for several other requirements, such as the integration of semantics, data or the support for different views.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Integration of rich semantics.</strong>
                            Other than prose, scholarly communication comprises rich semantic structures. This includes, in particular:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>the structure of the content, e.g. in sections, examples, definitions, theorems, notations;</li>
                                <li>the argumentation, e.g. premisses, assumptions, deductions, conclusions;</li>
                                <li>facts and relationships between entities expressed in sentences;</li>
                                <li>all kinds of data (examples, experiment results).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The more such semantics is accessible to machines, for querying (and ultimately automated reasoning), the easier it is to develop intelligent support services for scholars, such as recommendation, search and even comparison for related work.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>World-wide unique identification of entities.</strong>
                            One aspect of the integration of semantics is that entities in the content are identifiable. Entities can be any abstract or concrete thing refereed to from the scholarly communication, such as people, methods, diseases, phenotypes, organizations etc. etc. Usually every sentence contains references to to or more such entities. For the scholar it must be possible to create his own identifiers for the entities as well as to reuse existing identifiers coined by others. As a result, it will be more easily possible to identify content referring to the same entities, which is currently a challenging and error-prone task, which usually involves natural language processing techniques (e.g. named entity recognition and disambiguation).
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Integration of data.</strong>
                            In most cases some form of structured data is a direct element of the scholarly communication. In social sciences, for example, statistical data plays a key role as ground truth for validating or falsifying theories. Similarly in engineering and natural sciences, measurement or observation data is of crucial importance. In life-sciences, statistics, anonymized patient data as well as taxonomic and ontological data plays a key role. Ideally, such data is also a direct and integrated part of the digital representation of scholarly communication. This can, for example, be realized by embedding the data directly within the scholarly communication or by linking it.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Integration of interactive content.</strong>
                            New media, devices and interaction techniques provide the possibility to interact with the content. Hence, scholarly content should provide dynamic and interactive content. Examples are:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>executable software source code snippets, which demonstrate algorithms, queries, workflows etc.</li>
                                <li>interactive data visualizations with different diagram types, which allow users to zoom in, filter etc.</li>
                                <li>small games or self assessment tests, which allow readers to interact with the content in a playful way or to test their comprehension of the knowledge</li>
                                <li>widgets or applications, which provide interactive domain specific interactive content (e.g. exploring a large phenotype taxonomy)</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p><strong>Support for multimedia.</strong>
                            Multimedia content such as videos, audio, 3-d simulations etc. can dramatically improve the comprehension of scholarly content compared to the traditional static 2-d illustrations currently found in papers. Especially, fields dealing a lot with multimedia data like engineering, arts, audio and video analysis, medicine would benefit.</p>

                            <p><strong>Support for different levels of granularity.</strong>
                            Depending on the audience, scholarly communication should happen on different levels of granularity. For experts in the field, explanations can be shorter, examples are not required and only few illustrations are needed. For newbies on the other hand, more detailed explanations, illustrations and examples are helpful. Ideally, scholarly content can adapt to the audience. This should happen from a single source of content, where content elements are marked in such a way the the adaptation to the audience can be performed largely automatic.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Support for different views.</strong>
                            The technological development in the last decades resulted in a wide variety of media (e.g. electronic online/offline media in addition to conventional paper), devices (desktop, mobile, tablets, smart TVs, screen readers, e-books etc.) and interaction techniques (touch screens, audio).
                            Scholarly communication should exploit these different media, presentation and interaction techniques. The content should adapt to the available presentation capabilities and provide different means to interact with the content.</p>

                            <p><strong>Support for decentralised authoring and publishing.</strong>
                            Centralised services which require account creations and data storage for scholarly communication poses risks in which information is essentially controlled and gets to be only accessible by the privileged. However, by enabling researchers to create, share and participate in a decentralised manner - for instance with personal online dataspaces - the formation of information silos can be prevented. The architecture and the tooling to author and publish information should be possible by lowering the barriers to create and store data.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Granular access controls.</strong>
                            Having the means to set granular access controls to information allows content creators to decide who, when and what may be accessed for reading and writing. For example, some roles in the publication process may have authoring rights, meanwhile peer-reviewers may only be allowed to annotate a given article. Furthermore, the reviewer's annotations may only be visible to the editors for approval before going public.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Open Access.</strong>
                            In order to make new discoveries and spread that knowledge around to wide extent, research objects and communications should be accessible by anyone, anywhere, and any time. Ideally this maximization is achieved by way of free-access and reuse of all material e.g., code, media, source text, data and metadata - in scientific communication. While we borrow this requirement from the well-known <cite>Open Access</cite> movement, its application should be void of third-party services - typically via <cite>Gold</cite> and <cite>Green</cite> open access - so that knowledge can be distributed to any demographic; regardless of wealth, social status, or geographical location.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Provenance and accountability of information.</strong>
                            Where applicable, scientific processes should be captured in a way that is machine-readable, encompassing workflow and provenance level data. This type of information plays an important role in reproducibility of work, and fostering trust and confidence in data and results. For instance, systems that include useful derivations of its sources can be purposed towards coherent explanations of analysis, query constructs for data aggregation, as well as metadata about the used tools, license, production timestamps, and responsible agents for the generated analysis.
                            </p>

                            <p><strong>Persistence.</strong>

                            <p>We describe an <em>acid test</em> so that systems can be evaluated against the requirements of the Linked Research paradigm. The evaluation is intended to verify, approve, or test the openness, accessibility, decentralisation, interoperability of the approaches in scholarly communication. This is along the lines of a test to distinguish gold from base metals. This test does not mandate a specific technology, therefore the challenge can be met by different solutions. It is intended to test the design philosophies so that different approaches may be closer to passing the <em>independent invention</em> test.</p>

                                    <p>As Linked Data become mainstreamed and widely adopted by the Galleries, Libraries, Museums and Archives (GLAM) communities, currently <span about="#r-abc123" class="ref" typeof="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text"><mark id="r-abc123">there are many options for identifiers systems for authors, artists and other types of creators of scholarly, popular and creative works</mark><sup class="ref-footnote"><a href="#abc123" rel="cito:isCitedBy">abc123</a></sup></span>. Similarly for the scientific and medical research communities, the major researcher identity systems available to date via databases are <a href="https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/support/authorprofile">Scopus Author Identifier</a> (Elsevier) and <a href="http://www.researcherid.com/Home.action">ResearcherID</a> (Thomson Reuters). However, the data are not open. Nonetheless, both can be linked to the open researcher identifier system, <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> (Open Researcher and Contributor Identifier). <span about="#r-def456" class="ref" typeof="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text"><mark id="r-def456">Scholars also tend to deposit their research in different systems and with inconsistency and irregularity of updates</mark><sup class="ref-footnote"><a href="#def456" rel="cito:isCitedBy">def456</a></sup></span>. Linked Research (LR) can remedy this problem as authors will have all their works connected via their unique Web identifiers embedded in their publications or creative works on the Web. Thus they just need to establish one unique Web identifier that can be applied to all of their works, instead of multiple profiles to satisfy many systems as in their current practices. It will also solve the need to disambiguate among authors or creators as their published and creative works on the Web are readily connected to their unique Web identifiers embedded in their works.  In short, LR will revolutionize and simplify the way researchers, libraries and archives will manage the researcher identifiers, once adopted and mainstreamed.</p>

                                    Why persistance?
                                    - Building on top of knowledge far in the future
                                    - New discoveries -&gt; finding the sources
                                    - more on the vision
                                    - the role of the author/the role of the author

                                    survivability on the web
                                    - personal data archival
                                    - distributed storage

                                    Problems of centralized archival
                                    - Self-archival is difficult
                                    - The maintainer and their responsibilities
                                      - Self-hosted require mantainance (not accessible to those with no technical knowledge)
                                      - Third-party depend on the persistence of the service (it may have a cost)
                                    - URLs could be unreacheable and Web pages may disappear
                                      - downtime
                                      - censorship
                                      - under attack [find case]
                                      - expiration
                                    - Expiration
                                      - Domain name can expire
                                      - Running services may disappear
                                    - Accessibility: Not everyone has a domain name and storage
                                    =&gt; Finally, self-archival is a single point of failure for persistance

                                    There is a need of distributing the content
                                    - Distributed: Replicating the content
                                      - There is a need to make the content easy to distribute.
                                      - Hosted in multiple places
                                      - LOCKSS (Lot of copies keep stuff safe) - used by many libraries and projects: e.g. Perma.cc
                                      - Having the ability to retrieve it, point to it in case one of the place is down
                                    - the open problem of naming
                                      - current system using centralized naming
                                      - distribute naming (that everyone agrees upon)
                                        - hashing (DHT, see IPFS)
                                        - consensus (mostly built by offloading blockchains see BlockStore)
                                      - who has the data? trusty uris can come handy

                            <p>The Internet and the Web have radically changed the the processes of scholarship <cite> Borgman 2007 Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet </cite>. Many forms of scholarship are enabled by these technology changes whether it is the ability to perform social science using social media traces to large scale data processing for physics. However, as previously stated, the formal communication mechanisms used by scholars still do not take full advantage of the capabilities of the web.</p>

                            <p>Several authors have noted the lack of adoption.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Adoption and use of Web 2.0 in scholarly communications. Rob Procter, Robin Williams, James Stewart, Meik Poschen, Helene Snee, Alex Voss, Marzieh Asgari-Targhi Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2010 368 4039-4056; DOI: 10.1098/rsta.2010.0155. Published 2 August 2010</li>
                                <li>Calvi, Licia, and Maria Cassella. "Scholarship 2.0: analyzing scholarsâ€™ use of Web 2.0 tools in research and teaching activity." Liber Quarterly 23.2 (2013): 110-133.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>However, we increasingly see the adoption of web technologies within a parallel communication mechanisms. <cite><a href="http://crctcs.openum.ca/files/sites/60/2015/12/SSHRC_SocialMediainScholarlyCommunication.pdf">Samantha Work, Stefanie Haustein, Timothy D. Bowman, Vincent LariviÃ¨re. Social Media in Scholarly Communication. 2015.</a></cite></p>

                            <p>Even with this relatively slow adoption there are signs of web technologies being embraced by the infrastructure that surrounds traditional publication practice. For example, the progressive adoption of the DOI infrastructure for citation of both articles but other artefacts is a strong step towards Linked Research. Both CrossRef and DataCite DOIs support <a href="http://www.crosscite.org/cn/">Content Negotiation</a> allowing multiple representations including machine readable representations to be returned. Likewise, <a href="http://orcid.org">ORCID</a> allows for the unique identification of contributors and is available through content negotiations (http://feed.labs.orcid-eu.org).</p>

                            <p>Indeed, we are beginning to see a linked graph of information around publications based on these DOI focused infrastructures. (See http://blog.crossref.org/2016/01/crossref-the-art-of-cartography.html)</p>

                            <p>Semantic Web technologies have been widely embraced by the librarian community for organizing traditional scholarly content as well as exposing the rich terminological systems underlying those contents.<cite>Library Linked Data in the Cloud: OCLC's Experiments with New Models of Resource Description. Carol Jean Godby, Shenghui Wang, and Jeffrey K. Mixter Synthesis Lectures on the Semantic Web: Theory and Technology 2015 5:2, 1-154</cite> For example, the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/">BIBFRAME initiative</a> aims to ease the transition from MARC metadata records to web enabled metadata systems.</p>

                            <p>However, these systems are around the periphery of what remains the article. A more important sign of the potential for social movement toward web scholarly native and machine readable scholarly communication ecosystem are the recent recognition of the importance of other research products. For example, the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles <cite>Data Citation Synthesis Group: Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles. Martone M. (ed.) San Diego CA: FORCE11; 2014 [https://www.force11.org/datacitation].</cite> explicitly calls for data to be treated the same as papers in the scholarly ecosystem. It also explicitly calls for machine readability. These principle shave endorsed by 100 organizations.</p>

                            <p>Similarly, the <a href="http://datafairport.org">FAIR Data principles</a> for findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable data encourage the semantically interoperable reuse of data.</p>

                            <p> Beyond data, there are calls for the recognition of software as a critical form of research output. <cite>Stan Ahalt, Tom Carsey, Alva Couch, Rick Hooper, Luis Ibanez, Ray Idaszak, Matthew B. Jones, Jennifer Lin, and Erin Robinson. 2015. NSF Workshop on Supporting Scientific Discovery Through Norms and Practices for Software and Data Citation and Attribution. Technical Report. National Science Foundation, , USA.</cite>. Approaches for supporting software also leverage the DOI infrastructure (e.g. https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/)</p>

                            <p>Another form of scholarly output that is critical to the Linked Research vision is annotation. The recent announcement of the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/528153a">Annotating All Knowledge Coalition</a> is a major step towards a set of linked annotations that are openly available. The coalition is embracing <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/12/annotation-coalition-launched/">W3C open annotation standards</a> for interchanging standards.</p>

                            <p>Other groups are focused on reforming the traditional structure and content of narrative papers into more technically accessible and reusable content. For example, <a href="http://rescience.github.io">The ReScience Journal</a> makes available the various portions of a paper on Github to be accessed and re-executed if possible. Likewise, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/scholarlyhtml/">W3C Scholarly HTML working group</a> is focused on the better support of scholarly documents on the web.</p>

                            <p>Linked Research is additive to these various initiatives by providing a framework for thinking about each how these parts fit together and can be grounded in the web. By establishing a framework, Linked Research can be seen as a both a benchmarking exercise as well as a technique to connect various technologies.</p>

                            <p>Socially, Linked Research is embedded within the Open Science movement <cite>Neylon C, Wu S. Open Science: tools, approaches, and implications. Pac Symp Biocomput. 2009:540-4</cite>. However, it explicitly calls out the role of technical choices on meeting open science goals.</p>
