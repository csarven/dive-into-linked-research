                          <p>The future of scholarly communication involves research results, analysis and data all being produced, published, verified and reused interactively on the Web, with ‘papers’ linking to and from each other at a granular level.
                            The academic process of peer review is increasingly becoming open, transparent and decentralised.
                            More broadly, the mechanism for global knowledge sharing is becoming an ongoing conversation between experts, policy makers, implementers, and the general public.</p>

                          <p>This vision is radical, and getting there requires understanding of, and change in, a number of interrelated areas.
                            In this article we break down the problem space and define requirements for advancement towards a Web-based ecosystem for scholarly communication: <em>Linked Research</em>.
                            We discuss our strategy for tackling each of these areas.
                            This includes how we can build on and combine existing well-known technologies and practices for digital publishing, social interactions, decentralised data storage, and semantic data enrichment.
                            We provide an initial assessment of our proposed strategy with an example implementation of tooling which sets out to meet the requirements.</p>

To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete</q> – attributed to <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller">Buckminster Fuller</a></cite>.</p>

                            <p>One of the most widely debated questions in the scientific community is the impact of digitisation on scholarly communication and knowledge exchange; the Internet and the Web have radically changed the processes of scholarship [Borgman 2007 Scholarship in the Digital Age: Information, Infrastructure, and the Internet].
                              In this article, we propose that digitising, and indeed <em>Webizing</em>[cite], scholarly communication can provide greater coherency between and within academic fields, as well as make knowledge more accessible to researchers and citizens alike.
                              Many forms of scholarship are enabled by these technology changes, be it the ability to perform social science using social media traces, or large scale data processing for physics.
                              Despite efforts through Open Access movements and increasing availability of online publications, the formal communications mechanisms used by scholars do little to take full advantage of either the capabilities of online media, or the cultural shift towards sharing and public commentary on social networks [Adoption and use of Web 2.0 in scholarly communications. Rob Procter, Robin Williams, James Stewart, Meik Poschen, Helene Snee, Alex Voss, Marzieh Asgari-Targhi Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2010 368 4039-4056; DOI: 10.1098/rsta.2010.0155. Published 2 August 2010 , Calvi, Licia, and Maria Cassella. "Scholarship 2.0: analyzing scholars’ use of Web 2.0 tools in research and teaching activity." Liber Quarterly 23.2 (2013): 110-133.].</p>

                            <p>On examination, it becomes clear that there are many interrelated problems to be tackled before it will be possible to fully realise the possibilities offered by modern Web technologies in the academic space.
                              Many of these problems are relevant in a number of domains outside of scholarly publishing, and they are each to different degrees being considered in existing or ongoing work, in both academia and industry.Our first contribution is an overview of different issues, briefly summarising the extent to which they are addressed in current work, and how they relate to and depend upon one another in the context of scholarly communication.
                              We attempt to articulate a complete picture of the space by defining <em>requirements</em> in response to the problems described in existing literature, or observed ‘in the field’.
                              These requirements fall into three broad categories:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Publishing and ownership of documents and data.</li>
                                <li>Discovery and reuse of knowledge and data.</li>
                                <li>User experience and tooling.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>From these requirements, we derive user stories, and explain how these may be repurposed as an <em>acid test</em> or criteria against which to evaluate proposed solutions.

                              Our strategy for addressing the problems identified involves building upon existing technologies, standards and best practices, each of which we discuss in detail in section 4.</p>

                            <p>Finally, we describe an implementation of tooling for authoring, publishing and annotating research articles in a decentralised manner, based on native Web technologies.
                              We demonstrate how multimodal content such as video, audio, code examples and runnable experiments can be embedded into research publications, and showcase how different views of the content can be rendered for different devices (e.g. screen, print, mobile) or audiences (e.g. slideshows).
                              A particular strength of our approach is the integration and linking of data, which can automatically update tables and diagrams when the underlying data changes.
                              All content can be annotated and represented using semantic knowledge representation formalisms to facilitate better search, exploration, retrieval and linking of concepts and ideas. Further, our implementation takes advantage of common social media practices to enable sharing and commentary around scholarly work in both ongoing dialogue between interested parties, and more formal conference and workshop settings. We build upon emerging standards in personal data stores, annotations and social notifications to allow our implementation to be completely decentralised, reliant on no central system or hub.</p>

                          <p>The Linked Research requirements provide a framework for thinking about how each of the various parts of the problem space fit together.
                            By establishing a framework, Linked Research can be seen as both a benchmarking exercise as well as a technique to connect various technologies and approaches.
                            The topic areas are described below, and we have identified several interdependencies between them, whereby aspects of one problem are much more easily solved alongside of or on the back of another.*</p>

                          <p>Socially, Linked Research is embedded within the Open Science movement [Neylon C, Wu S. Open Science: tools, approaches, and implications. Pac Symp Biocomput. 2009:540-4].
                            However, it explicitly calls out the role of technical choices in meeting open science goals.</p>

                                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                                  <p><b>Open Access.</b> To better enable scientific progress, research work, from raw results to completed analysis, should be widely available and accessible by anyone, anywhere, at any time.<mark>← CL: can this be backed by a citation?  The “anyone/anywhere/anytime” reminds me of something you frequently read about open <em>courseware</em>; maybe it's also been mentioned for open <em>science</em>?</mark>
                                    Maximising reach in this way increases the likelihood of further scientific progress and new discoveries [cite: someone who says something about research 'accidents' and unexpected connections and reuse of work].
                                    Ideally this is achieved by way of free-of-charge access and reuse of all material, including code, media, source text, data and metadata.
                                    This requirement is borrowed from the well-known <em>Open</em> Access movement, however this still often contains restrictions imposed by third parties such as publishers, inhibiting the distribution of knowledge to any demographic, regardless of wealth, social status, or geographical location of either the researcher or the consumer [cite: criticism of OA].</p>

                                  <p><b>Support for decentralised authoring and publishing.</b> Research is commonly published through centralised services today.
                                    Publishers of journals or conference proceedings act as gatekeepers to work, which may only be available behind a paywall, and is required to meet certain criteria before it is published<mark>← CL: even most progressive people would probably still agree that papers should meet certain <em>quality</em> criteria before published.  We could certainly advocate complete openness, i.e. that you publish first, and that the big community rather than a few gatekeepers <em>then</em> assesses quality.  However I do not yet see the term “quality” in this paper.</mark>.
                                    Existing services which allow researchers to upload their own work directly to a database require proprietary processing (e.g. to extract metadata), account creation, and may distribute work only to other users of that service.<mark>← CL: would be good to mention at least one example</mark>
                                    If such a service shuts down, links to the work and any additional value extracted from it by the service, are lost [cite? has an academic social network gone down yet?].
                                    In both cases, control over access and distribution of the work is taken out of the hands of the original author, and the author may additionally be required to give up their rights to distribute their work by other means [cite].
                                    We propose that it must be possible for authors to opt out of such information silos [cite: for term 'information silos'] and publish work on their own terms, in a storage location controlled by themselves or someone they trust, without being excluded from the wider community.</p>

                                  <p><b>Access control and attribution.</b> In many fields, researchers are discouraged from publishing unfinished, inconclusive or ongoing work, or publishing outside of ‘official’ venues by the risk that their work will be plagiarised or reused by another without permission or due credit [cite].
                                    To facilitate open scientific discourse, technologies for publishing must afford a trust that sharing work will not disadvantage the author.
                                    Thus the author must have means to unambiguously attach their identifying information to their own work, and selectively grant and revoke access to others during the research process.
                                    Presently there are many services offering identifiers to creators of scholarly work: the Library of Congress Linked Data Service for personal and family names and corporate bodies, the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF), the International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI), the Getty’s Union List of Artist Names (ULAN), ResearchGate, Google Scholar, Scopus Author Identifier (Elsevier), ResearcherID (Thomson Reuters) and ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID).
                                    These systems are minimally, if at all, interoperable, so creating multiple profiles is common practice.
                                    Some of these systems support – not via open standards but by individual solutions – certain others, e.g., ORCID can import data from ResearcherID.
                                    It is part of our vision to empower authors to choose an identity provider they trust, and use a single preferred identifier across their publications.</p>

                                  <p><b>Provenance and accountability of information.</b> Trust and confidence in data and results can be fostered by enabling reproducibility of experiments, and demonstrating a coherent explanation of the derivation of conclusions, and the agents responsible; however this tends to be difficult under current practices [cite].
                                    Capturing scientific processes, workflows and data origins in a machine-readable way will further improve the utility of researchers' work.</p>

                                  <p><b>Persistence and long term preservation.</b> Research results must be made available in such a way that access to it is reliable and consistent over time, and irrespective of place.
                                    Broken links, missing data, authors who move institution, organisations which close or merge or rename, and regimes which censor can all hamper access to and reuse of knowledge [cite if poss].
                                    A Linked Research ecosystem strives for persistent, long-term access to information as a technical and social norm.</p>

                                  <p><b>Sharing and social interactions.</b> Authors largely rely on third parties, including publishers and the media, to distribute and raise awareness their work [cite].
                                    However, increasing numbers of academics are making use of social media to this end, and sharing on the Web has become a normal part of daily life for many [cite, cite, http://crctcs.openum.ca/files/sites/60/2015/12/SSHRC_SocialMediainScholarlyCommunication.pdf].
                                    Linked Research will capitalise on this trend.</p>

                                  <p><b>Commentary and feedback.</b> The academic peer-review process has been used to judge whether work is worthy of publication for centuries.
                                    Studies are beginning to show the unreliability and elitist nature of this process [cite, cite] and thus we call for transparency and broader participation in research discourse.
                                    It should be possible and expected for anyone to review academic work, and for this review to be attributed and recognised as a contribution of the reviewer in its own right.</p>

                                  <p><b>Human and machine-readability.</b> Scholarly content, mostly published in PDF form, is currently not machine-readable to the extent that automatic post-processing is possible.
                                    Desirable modes of post-processing include sorting, aggregation and more accessible display of information, to improve the ease of use by humans.
                                    Many aggregation and indexing systems require manual input of metadata (or careful scraping by proprietary software), and authors undertake this labour, often repeatedly across different systems, for the pay-off of improving findability of their work [cite].
                                    This labour can be avoided by generating metadata from article content and publishing it according to a standard syntax and semantics.</p>

                                    <p><b>Integration of rich semantics.</b> Within and around the prose, scholarly communication comprises rich semantic structures:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>the structure of the content, e.g. in sections, examples, definitions, theorems, notations;</li>
                                        <li>the argumentation, e.g. premises, assumptions, deductions, conclusions;</li>
                                        <li>facts and relationships between entities expressed in sentences;</li>
                                        <li>all kinds of data (examples, experiment results).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                  <p>Notably, <mark>CL: the following reference is syntactically broken (opening square bracket never closed), but I don't know the source's title well enough to fix it. →</mark>[Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles Data Citation Synthesis Group: Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles. Martone M. (ed.) San Diego CA: FORCE11; 2014 [https://www.force11.org/datacitation], endorsed by over 100 organisations, explicitly calls for data to be treated the same as papers in the scholarly ecosystem, and for machine readability of the data.
                                    Similarly, the FAIR Data principles for <u>f</u>indable, <u>a</u>ccessible, <u>i</u>nteroperable and <u>r</u>eusable data encourage the semantically interoperable reuse of data.</p>

                                    <p>Making this level of semantic structure available to machines for querying (and ultimately automated reasoning) facilitates development of intelligent support services for scholars, such as recommendation, search and even comparison for related work.</p>

                                  <p><b>Globally unique identification of entities.</b> A research document contains references to <em>things</em>, from abstract concepts to real-world objects; anything which may be referenced from a publication (people, methods, diseases, phenotypes, organizations, and so on).
                                    For the scholar it must be possible to unambiguously indicate the subjects of discussion by creating their own identifiers for these entities or by reusing existing identifiers coined by others.
                                    This will facilitate associates between content referring to the same entities, which currently is a challenging and error-prone task involving natural language processing techniques (e.g. named entity recognition and disambiguation) [cite].</p>

                                  <p>The progressive adoption of the DOI infrastructure for citation of artefacts other than articles is a strong step towards this area of Linked Research.
                                    Indeed, we are now beginning to see a linked graph of information around publications based on these DOI focused infrastructures [http://blog.crossref.org/2016/01/crossref-the-art-of-cartography.html].</p>

                                  <p><b>Integration of data.</b> In many cases some form of structured data is a direct subject of scholarly communication.
                                    In social sciences, for example, statistical data plays a key role as ground truth for validating or falsifying theories.
                                    Similarly, in engineering and natural sciences, measurement or observation data is of crucial importance.
                                    In the life sciences, statistics, anonymised patient data as well as taxonomic and ontological data can be central.
                                    Ideally, such data is directly integrated into the digital representation of a scholarly article in both human- and machine-readable forms.
                                    This facilitates both live updates to the article (including charts and figures) as new data emerges with no extra effort to the authors, and the ability for closer exploration of the data for better understanding by consumers.</p>

                                  <p><b>Integrated authoring and publication workflow. </b> Researchers should be enabled as far as possible to have a seamless experience when making their work available to their community and to the general public.
                                    This spans from basic authoring of text content according to the desired layout, to embedding data and interactive elements, to managing citations, footnotes and metadata, and finally to publishing the article in the preferred location [cite: something for people complaining about latex/source code editing?].</p>

                                  <p><b>Feedback and interactions.</b> When others interact with published work, for example to cite, comment, review, share, recommend or annotate, the original authors should be notified and able to view and react to any new content produced in response to their work.
                                    Conversations and commentary may be stored across different systems, however there must be a mechanism for aggregating and displaying scientific discourse around the subject resources to benefit authors and consumers alike.</p>

                                  <p><b>Support for different views.</b> Content is consumed in a wide variety of formats online and offline, on devices of different sizes and capabilities, and with different interaction techniques (touch screens, speech input/output).
                                    Scholarly communication should exploit these different media, presentation and interaction techniques to allow scholarly content to be consumed in different situations [Cite: something about cooling down?].
                                    The content should adapt to the available presentation capabilities, and alter its appearance according to some combination of the author's and consumer's preferences.</p>

                                  <p><b>Adaptation to audiences.</b> Depending on the audience, presentation of scholarly communication should happen on different levels of granularity.
                                    For experts in the field, explanations can be shorter, examples are not required and only few illustrations are needed.
                                    For newcomers on the other hand, more detailed explanations, illustrations and examples are helpful.
                                    Ideally, scholarly content can adapt to the audience.
                                    This should happen from a single source of content to minimise the burden on the author, where content elements are marked in such a way the the adaptation to the audience can be performed largely automatically.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Integration of interactive content.</strong> Where possible, scholarly content should provide dynamic and interactive content [say and Cite: something about learnability/education]. Examples include:
                                    </p>

Jones, Jennifer Lin, and Erin Robinson. 2015. NSF Workshop on Supporting Scientific Discovery Through Norms and Practices for Software and Data Citation and Attribution. Technical Report. National Science Foundation, , USA.] calls for these to be considered as a critical research output).</li>
                                        <li>interactive data visualizations with different diagram types, which allow users to zoom in, filter etc.</li>
                                        <li>small games or self assessment tests, which allow readers to interact with the content in a playful way or to test their comprehension of the knowledge</li>
                                        <li>widgets or applications, which provide interactive domain specific interactive content (e.g. exploring a large phenotype taxonomy)</li>

                                    <p><strong>Support for multimedia.</strong>
                                      Multimedia content such as videos, audio, and 3-d simulations can dramatically improve the comprehension of scholarly content compared to the traditional static 2-d illustrations currently found in papers.
                                      In particular, fields dealing a lot with multimedia data like engineering, arts, audio and video analysis, and medicine, would benefit [cite!].</p>

                                  <p>Frontend Web technologies - HTML, CSS and JavaScript - can be purposed towards authoring tools that are straightforward for authors and require no proprietary software or special configurations to use; all that is needed is a modern Web browser. Such tools can be used to edit local files when the author is offline, but can support writing directly to a personal data store or server when the author is online to facilitate collaboration. Authors can easily go beyond textual content, and embed data, interactive or multimedia elements into their work with native Web components. Authoring tools built on the Web can be extended or built upon with little overhead to meet specific needs of researchers.</p>
                                  <p>Semantic Web technologies have been widely embraced by the librarian community for organizing traditional scholarly content as well as exposing the rich terminological systems underlying such content. [Library Linked Data in the Cloud: OCLC's Experiments with New Models of Resource Description. Carol Jean Godby, Shenghui Wang, and Jeffrey K. Mixter Synthesis Lectures on the Semantic Web: Theory and Technology 2015 5:2, 1-154]. For example, the BIBFRAME initiative aims to ease the transition from MARC metadata records to web enabled metadata systems, and both CrossRef and DataCite DOIs support Content Negotiation allowing multiple representations including machine readable representations to be returned.</p><p>We propose to use RDFa embedded in HTML to add fine-grained semantics to prose content, including metadata (eg. authors, keywords), document structure (eg. abstract, conclusion), components and concepts being described (eg. methodological steps, hypotheses, specific instances of things). A browser-based authoring tool should both automatically generate RDFa where possible, and provide a user-friendly interface to allow the author to add semantics themselves.</p>

                                    <p>The Linked Research initiative encourages researchers to work transparently, publish early and often and without asking for permission. The Web provides the perfect platform for this. Ideally authors should acquire their own domain name and Web hosting; we acknowledge that this isn't always possible or practical, though many institutions provide basic Web hosting and a URL space for all of their staff and students.</p><p>Publishing work online in static HTML allows wide accessibility for consumers. Using CSS and JavaScript makes it possible to refine, adapt or even provide alternative views on a research document according to the consumer's needs or viewing context. </p><p>Distributing work with URLs allows sharing equally between academics and specialists, and interested citizens. Linking between articles enhances discoverability, and coupling this with social notifications (ActivityStreams 2.0 is an appropriate emerging W3C standard which would enable interoperability with other decentralised social systems) allows authors to track citations, the reach of their work, and receive and display responses and feedback. </p><p>It is important to include licensing information with published work. We do not presume to dictate the most appropriate licenses for academic work to be released under, however it is worth emphasising that establishing common practices around open licenses (such as ....) is important to encourage a culture of openness and reuse which, as we previously discussed, is important for healthy scientific progress.</p>

                            <p>We describe an <em>acid test</em> so that systems can be evaluated against the requirements of Linked Research previously outlined. The evaluation is intended to verify the openness, accessibility, decentralisation, interoperability of approaches in scholarly communication, and takes the form of a series of user stories which must be feasible to carry out with the proposed system. This test does not mandate a specific technology, therefore the challenge can be met by different solutions. It is intended to test the design philosophies so that different approaches may be closer to passing the <em>independent invention</em> test.</p>

                                <h3 property="schema:name">Authoring and publishing</h3>
                                <div datatype="rdf:HTML" property="schema:description">
                                    <p>We take a look at three publication areas; research articles and objects, call for contributions, and academic proceedings.</p>

                                    <p>For research articles, <a href="#dokieli">dokieli</a> and <a href="#solid">Solid</a> are employed as follows:</p>

                                    <p id="dokieli"><cite><a href="http://csarven.ca/dokieli">dokieli</a></cite> [] is an open source, progressively enhanced client-side linked data application for decentralised authoring, annotations and social notifications. The editor is built on open Web standards and the documents are compliant with Linked Data best practices, allowing: decentralised storage and data ownership; fine-grained semantic structure through HTML+RDFa for prose content, and other RDF formats for data embedding; direct in-browser editing from a W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/">Linked Data Platform</a>-based personal data store; social interactions with documents (such as annotations and replies), and notifications thereof.</p>

                                    <p id="solid">dokieli is compliant with <cite><a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-spec">Solid</a></cite>, a set of protocols and conventions based on the LDP recommendation. This incorporates authentication, access control and read and write access to a personal datastore. Hosting a dokieli document on a Solid server allows the author to edit the document directly from a space they control, and grant permissions to collaborators to do so as well. There are a number of open source Solid server implementations already, and users may host their own or choose a provider. There also exist <a href="https://github.com/solid/solid-platform">Solid tools and libraries</a> to help developers to build their own Solid-compliant datastore.</p>

                                    <p id="semantics-and-linking"><strong>Semantics and linking</strong>. The data format of dokieli documents is designed to encourage machine-readable description of ideas and knowledge, which becomes particularly powerful when these individual ideas can be linked to each other with semantically meaningful relationships. A document author can assign a URI to concepts at any level, permitting reference to the document as a whole, a single phrase, or anything in between. Concepts within a single document can be related to each other with the appropriate RDF properties, as well as creating specific relations with external resources. dokieli takes a bottom-up approach to semantic content authoring; <a href="#figure-dokieli-rdfa">figure dokieli-rdfa</a> shows our user interface for this, whereby the author selects some text, chooses the subject, predicate and object of a statement, and the application inserts the data as RDFa, and if necessary generates a new URI fragment for the subject or object.</p>

                                    <p>In addition, metadata that does not easily fit into prose (for example, <a href="http://nanopub.org/">Nanopublications</a>) can be embedded as a single block of Turtle, JSON-LD, or TriG (<a href="#figure-dokieli-nanopublication">figure dokieli-nanopublication</a>).</p>

                                    <p id="rich-editing"><strong>Rich editing.</strong> The current implementation of dokieli makes use of the open source <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">Medium Editor</a> for the features one would expect from a WYSIWYG editor (<a href="#figure-dokieli-edit-menu">figure dokieli-edit-menu</a>). We have extended this with buttons for RDFa embedding, annotations and other interactions. The edit menu itself is loosely coupled with the rest of the application logic, so the choice of edit menu can be changed in future if better libraries become available.</p>

                                    <p id="authentication-and-access-control"><strong>Authentication and access control.</strong> People can identify themselves to a dokieli document through <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/tls/">WebID-TLS</a>. Users with a browser certificate installed and a matching FOAF profile containing the certificate public key are authenticated against their own Solid server if found, with a fallback to a known Solid authentication endpoint. This allows the dokieli instance to write to any Solid-compliant dataspace which the user is authorised to write to. This is how users can, for example, save changes to a document, or store interactions such as comments.</p>

                                    <p id="storage"><strong>Storage.</strong> Articles may be stored on user’s local filesystem or hosted from ordinary Web servers which can serve static HTML files, for example: university user pages, code repositories, personal or company webspace, or any file hosting.</p>

                                    <p id="interactions"><strong>Interactions.</strong> We support the rights of authors to own their data, and store and publish it where they feel most comfortable. This includes the social interactions users make around existing publications. Rather than centralising these interactions around the subject document, we took the decision to default to decentralisation of all content by allowing users to authenticate with their personal dataspace, and choose the location for their interactions at the point of making them. This gives rise to the need for a mechanism to notify the original author that their document has received some interaction. We do this by allowing document authors to specify an <em>inbox</em> for either their article as a whole, or any subsection with its own URI using the Solid <code>inbox</code> predicate. Inboxes are containers in a dataspace which may be appended to by anyone, and do not need to be on the same server as the document itself; if one article has multiple inboxes they can be distributed across as many dataspaces as is convenient for the author(s). When an annotation is made, dokieli follows the appropriate <code>inbox</code> link and writes a notification there (see <a href="#figure-interactions-create">figure 17</a> for this process and <a href="#solid-notification">listing 1</a> for notification contents). When the document is loaded, links are followed to all inboxes in order to retrieve interactions there have been notifications about, so that these can be displayed along with the document (<a href="#figure-interactions-display">figure 18</a> and <a href="#figure-dokieli-interactions">figure 19</a>).</p>

                                    <p id="dokieli-notifications">Although providing enriched (meta)data is voluntary, provenance level data like the date on which the request was submitted, who by, and its license, can be purposed towards the verification process as well as for displaying. An example Solid inbox <strong class="highlight-notification">Notification</strong> is shown in Listing [<a href="#solid-notification">1</a>], in which <strong class="highlight-object">object</strong> is the URL of an annotation, and <strong class="highlight-context">context</strong> is the type of relation to the <strong class="highlight-target">target</strong> (the conclusions section of an article).</p>

                            <p>Another form of scholarly output that is critical to the Linked Research vision is annotation. The recent announcement of the <a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/528153a">Annotating All Knowledge Coalition</a> is a major step towards a set of linked annotations that are openly available. The coalition is embracing <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/2015/12/annotation-coalition-launched/">W3C open annotation standards</a> for interchanging standards.<br /></p>

                            <p>Other groups are focused on reforming the traditional structure and content of narrative papers into more technically accessible and reusable content. For example, <a href="http://rescience.github.io">The ReScience Journal</a> makes available the various portions of a paper on Github to be accessed and re-executed if possible. Likewise, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/scholarlyhtml/">W3C Scholarly HTML working group</a> is focused on the better support of scholarly documents on the web.</p>
